Overview of libopm API

1.0 Overview
-------------

   The open proxy monitor library provides an API interface to an open proxy
scanner. File descriptor and memory allocation are handled internally by calls
to API functions aswell as the main IO loop (opm_cycle). Configuration, callback
registry and protocol types are all on a scanner based level. This provides means
to create multiple 'virtual scanners', each with it's own configuration, limits
and protocols.


2.0 API Data Types
------------------

OPM_T
	This type holds information regarding a 'virtual scanner'. It is the highest
        type created to proxy scan.

OPM_REMOTE_T

        This structure holds information regarding a remote host. An OPM_REMOTE_T must
        be created for each host libopm will scan. The OPM_REMOTE_T struct will be passed
        back on callbacks, so that the client will be able to determine the IP, port and
        protocol in question.

        The OPM_REMOTE_T structure is defined in opm.h and is as follows:

        struct OPM_REMOTE_T {
           char              *ip;

           unsigned short int port;
           unsigned short int protocol;
           unsigned short int bytes_read;

           OPM_PROTOCOL_T    *protocols;

           void              *data;
         }

         The members of the OPM_REMOTE_T structure are:

         ip
            The ip of the host in human readble form.

         port
            Port used in callbacks.

         protocol
            Protocol used in callbacks.

         bytes_read
            Number of bytes read before the callback.

         callbacks
            An array of callbacks associated with this OPM_REMOTE_T. This
            element is handled internally by the API.

         data
            An arbitrary pointer used if the client program wants to store additional
            data in the remote struct. This can be used to avoid having to have a seperate
            list of scans outside of the library.

2.1 C API Functions
-------------------


OPM_T *opm_create(void)

   Parameters: None
   Return: Pointer to OPM_T

   The opm_create function is used to create a new scanner object. Memory for the object
   will be created internally and can be freed with the opm_free function.




void opm_free(OPM_T *)

   Parameters: Pointer to OPM_T object to free
   Return: None

   The opm_free struct will free a scanner object. All configuration and scans the scanner
   is engaged in will be destroyed.





OPM_REMOTE_T *opm_remote_create(char *)

    Parameters: Pointer to string containing human readable IP address of remote host
    Return: Pointer to OPM_REMOTE_T

    The opm_remote_create function will allocate and setup a OPM_REMOTE_T object which
    contains information on a remote host being scanned. OPM_REMOTE_T objects are passed
    to the scanner to initiate scanning, and then are passed back on events.





void opm_remote_free(OPM_REMOTE_T *)

   Parameters: OPM_REMOTE_T object to free
   Return: None

   The opm_remote_free function frees up an OPM_REMOTE_T struct.

   WARNING: Freeing an OPM_REMOTE_T struct after it has been passed to
            a scanner (via opm_scan) would give unpredictable results.

            It is only safe to free an OPM_REMOTE_T struct after the end scan
            callback has been called.



OPM_ERR_T opm_config(OPM_T *, int, void *)

   Parameters: OPM_T: object to set configuration options with
               int: configuration option to set
               void *: Pointer to data to set the data to

   Return: OPM_ERR_T or OPM_SUCCESS on success

           OPM_ERR_BADVALUE: Unable to set the given value (bad formatting).
           OPM_ERR_BADKEY: The key (configuration option) is unknown.

   The opm_config function sets various options on the individual scanner
   objects. A pointer to the data to set the option to is required. The scanner
   will make a copy of the data and store it internally.

   Configuration Types

      OPTION                     TYPE            DESCRIPTION
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------

      OPM_CONFIG_FD_LIMIT        int             Max file descriptor limit

      OPM_CONFIG_BIND_IP         char *          IP to bind to for outgoing scans

      OPM_CONFIG_TARGET_STRING   list of char *  Target strings used to verify open proxies

      OPM_CONFIG_SCAN_IP         char *          IP to command proxies to connect to

      OPM_CONFIG_SCAN_PORT       int             port to command proxies to connect to

      OPM_CONFIG_MAX_READ        int             Maximum amount of data (in bytes) to be read from
                                                 the remote connection until it is dropped.

      OPM_CONFIG_TIMEOUT         int             Time in seconds before a negotiation is considered
                                                 timed out, and closed.

      OPM_CONFIG_DNSBL_HOST      char *          DNSBL host



      Example:
                int fd_limit, max_read;
                OPM_T *scanner;

                scanner = opm_create();

                fd_limit = 1024;
                max_read = 4096;

                opm_config(scanner, OPM_CONFIG_FD_LIMIT, &fd_limit);
                opm_config(scanner, OPM_CONFIG_MAX_READ, &max_read);
                opm_config(scanner, OPM_CONFIG_BIND_IP, "10.0.0.1");
                opm_config(scanner, OPM_CONFIG_TARGET_STRING, "Match1");
                opm_config(scanner, OPM_CONFIG_TARET_STRING, "Match2");

                opm_free(scanner);



OPM_ERR_T opm_addtype(OPM_T *, int, int)
OPM_ERR_T opm_remote_addtype(OPM_REMOTE_T *, int, int)

   Parameters: OPM_T scanner to add type to
               int: type to add
               int: port of type to add

   Return: OPM_ERR_T  or OPM_SUCCESS on success

           OPM_ERR_BADPROTOCOL: Bad protocol type

   The opm_addtype function adds a protocol type and port to the scanner's
   protocol list. This list determines what ports the scanner will scan on,
   and what protocols it will check for on those ports. Each protocol/port will
   result in 1 file descriptor used per scan.

   The opm_remote_addtype functions works similarly, but adds the protocol
   configuration to an individual remote struct instead.


   Type                 Description
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   OPM_TYPE_HTTP        Open http proxies
   OPM_TYPE_SOCKS4      Open socks 4 proxies
   OPM_TYPE_SOCKS5      Open socks 5 proxies
   OPM_TYPE_ROUTER      Routers with default passwords set (usually cisco)
   OPM_TYPE_WINGATE     Open wingate proxy
   OPM_TYPE_POST        Opm HTTP post proxy

   Example:

   		OPM_T *scanner;
                scanner = opm_create();

                opm_addtype(scanner, OPM_TYPE_HTTP, 80);
                opm_addtype(scanner, OPM_TYPE_HTTP, 8080);
                opm_addtype(scanner, OPM_TYPE_HTTP, 3128);
                opm_addtype(scanner, OPM_TYPE_SOCKS4, 1080);
                opm_addtype(scanner, OPM_TYPE_SOCKS5, 1080);
                opm_addtype(scanner, OPM_TYPE_ROUTER, 23);
                opm_addtype(scanner, OPM_TYPE_WINGATE, 23);
                opm_addtype(scanner, OPM_TYPE_POST, 80);

                opm_free(scanner);


OPM_ERR_T opm_scan(OPM_T *, OPM_REMOTE_T *)

   Parameters: OPM_T: Scanner to scan on
               OPM_REMOTE_T: Object containing information on remote host to scan

   Return: OPM_ERR_T or OPM_SUCCESS on success

           OPM_ERR_BADADDR: The address within the OPM_REMOTE_T is not valid.
           OPM_ERR_NOPROTOCOLS: No protocols are configured.

   The opm_scan functions adds a remote host object to the scanner's scan queue
   (or begins scanning on it if there is no queue).

   Example:

   		OPM_T *scanner;
   		OPM_REMOTE_T *remote_host;

		scanner = opm_create();
		remote_host = opm_remote_create("10.0.0.1");

		opm_addtype(scanner, OPM_TYPE_HTTP, 80);

		opm_scan(scanner, remote_host);



void opm_end(OPM_T *, OPM_REMOTE_T *)
void opm_endscan(OPM_T *, OPM_REMOTE_T *)

   Parameters: OPM_T Scanner to end scan on
               OPM_REMOTE_T Scan to end

   Return: None, OPM_CALLBACK_END will still be called
                 when the scans end

   The opm_end function ends all scans using the passed OPM_REMOTE_T. The
   opm_endscan will only end active scans (scans in the queue are not
   traversed). This is useful if it is known only one scan using the remote
   struct exists, but it is also known that the scan has already active.
   Using opm_endscan will save time by not traversing the queue list.

   IMPORTANT: If the opm_end function ends any scans in the queue, the
              OPM_CALLBACK_END callback will be called immadiately for
              those scans. Any scans in the active scan list will be set
              OPM_STATE_CLOSED and OPM_CALLBACK_END for those scans will
              be called on the next opm_cycle.


OPM_ERR_T opm_callback(OPM_T *, int, OPM_CALLBACK_T, void *)

   Parameters: OPM_T: Scanner to set callbacks on
               int: Callback type
               OPM_CALLBACK_T: Pointer to custom callback function
               void *: Pointer to be passed back, this is generally NULL

   Return: OPM_ERR_T or OPM_SUCCESS on success

           OPM_ERR_CBNOTFOUND: The given callback type is unknown



   typedef void OPM_CALLBACK_T (OPM_T *, OPM_REMOTE_T *, int);


   The opm_callback function is used to set a scanner wide callback function
   for events. The opm_remote_callback can be used to set remote host specific
   callback functions.

   The first parameter to the callback function is the scanner in question, the
   second is the remote host object in question, and the third is an optional integer
   used for error codes.

   The the OPENPROXY, NEGFAIL, TIMEOUT, and ERROR functions, the OPM_REMOTE struct
   will have OPM_REMOTE_T::protocol, OPM_REMOTE_T::port and OPM_REMOTE_T::bytes_read
   set.

   Type                                 Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   OPM_CALLBACK_OPENPROXY                An open proxy has been found.

   OPM_CALLBACK_NEGFAIL                  Negotiation with the remote end has failed.

   OPM_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT                  Neogitation with the remote end has timed out

   OPM_CALLBACK_END                      Scan on remote host is complete, the OPM_REMOTE_T
                                         has been removed from the scanner and is safe to
                                         opm_remote_free

   OPM_CALLBACK_ERROR                    An error has occured.





void opm_cycle(OPM_T *)

   Parameters: OPM_T: Scanner to cycle
   Return: None

   opm_cycle passes one cycle to a scanner. During a cycle the following functions
   are performed in order:

   	1. Scans are moved from a queue list to a live scan list if OPM_CONFIG_FD_LIMIT has not
           yet been reached.

        2. Scans in the live scan list are 'established'. That is, if OPM_CONFIG_FD_LIMIT has not
           yet been reached, new connections will be established until OPM_CONFIG_FD_LIMIT is reached
           or all scans have active file descriptors.

        3. All scans are polled for read, write and negotiation failed events. Upon write event,
           negotiation related data is sent to the remote host to negotiate the open proxy. Upon
           read event, data is read in and tested against target strings. Upon negotiation fail (HUP)
           events, scans are marked closed.

        4. Free up the file descriptors of connections marked closed and remove such connections
           from the scan list. If no connections are left for a given remote host, consider the scan
           on that host ended and remove it from the scanner.

    opm_cycle will need to be called consistently within the main loop of the client application.
    opm_cycle will not block or cause delays. It is up to the client application to rate calls to
    opm_cycle in order to save CPU.
